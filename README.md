## Overview

For RNA structures, a native folding is the one with the lowest Gibbs free energy. The purpose of the project is to develop an objective function to estimate the energy and thus evaluating how close a predicted fold is to the optimal / native fold. 

## Dataset

We obtained 100 RNA structures from *Homo sapiens* from the [RCSB PDB REST API](https://www.rcsb.org/docs/programmatic-access/web-apis-overview). Each structure was obtained in both PDB and CIF formats.
